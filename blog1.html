                        <h3>When Time and Quality Miss the Point</h3>
                        <p>
                            A few months ago, I was building a small feature for a side project — something that should have taken a few hours.  
                            But somewhere along the way, I realized I was obsessing over how <em>fast</em> I was finishing it, and whether it was “high quality.”  
                            I stopped and asked myself — what do those words even mean in software?
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            In cooking, you can measure time and quality. A pizza takes 20 minutes, and you can tell if it’s burnt.  
                            But software isn’t a pizza. It’s not about turning dough into something edible.  
                            It’s more like building a new language — one where the alphabet keeps evolving as you write.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            The idea of “time” in software came from manufacturing — where work was predictable.  
                            And “quality” came from engineering — where parts either fit or fail.  
                            But in software, the problem itself changes as you solve it.  
                            What looks like “slow progress” might actually be deep learning;  
                            what looks “high quality” today might become irrelevant next month.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            A friend once said, “Software grows, it isn’t built.”  
                            That line stayed with me. Growth doesn’t have deadlines or grades.  
                            It just needs space — to explore, to fail, to understand.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Maybe that’s what bothers me about words like <em>time</em> and <em>quality</em>.  
                            They make software sound like a factory when it’s really a conversation —  
                            between your mind and the machine, between the idea and what it becomes.
                        </p>
